# Personal Website

Hi, I'm Namrata. I am a creative, innovative and detail-oriented front-end developer with a passion for UX/UI design. 

I specialize in designing intuitive, user-friendly interfaces that create a positive user experience. I have extensive experience in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, as well as a strong understanding of modern web development technologies and frameworks like React. 

I strive to create designs that are both aesthetically pleasing and highly functional. My commitment to staying up to date with the latest trends and technologies ensures that my designs stay fresh and engaging. I am excited to continue to push the boundaries of web design and create engaging experiences for users.

This is my personal website. An simple, easily modifiable, statically-exportable [React](https://reactjs.org/) application that deploys automatically for free using [github pages](https://pages.github.com/). 
Built using modern javascript, based on [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) with [React-Router](https://reactrouter.com/), SCSS, [github actions](https://github.com/features/actions), and many other useful technologies.
